Welcome to this very sparse website tucked away in some corner of the Internet. 

I use this space primarly to dump information that needs to be public-facing, such as application usage documenation.

If you're here for me, you may be better served by my [github]() and [linkedin]() pages.


#### Technical Details

Webpages on this site are generated using [PicoCMS](http://picocms.org/), a lightweight, open-source, flat-file content management system. PicoCMS parses Markdown-formatted files into pages rendered using a configured PicoCMS theme. 

This all translates into website that is easy to deploy and maintain. I use ``git`` to sync my content pages with Github, and use Github's built-in Markdown editor to create webpages. The website runs on limited hardware easily, and so it is incredibly inexpensive to rent the necessary server-space.
