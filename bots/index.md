## Fate / Bots

Fate / Bots is a series of bots aiming to fill the gaps in functionality that exist between the popular multi-function discord bots. These bots are designed to fulfil a single purpose, and fulfil that purpose well. If there exists a role that none of the popular bots fill, get in contact with me and I'd be happy to craft a bot with your need in mind.
