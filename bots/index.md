## Fate / Bots

> Fate / Bots is a series of bots aiming to fill the gaps in functionality that exist between the popular multi-function discord bots. These bots are designed to fulfil a single purpose, and fulfil that purpose well. If there exists a role that none of the popular bots fill, get in contact with me and I'd be happy to craft a bot with your need in mind.

### [Saber](http://nmathe.ws/bots/saber "Saber bot") 

A bot for scheduling events for your Discord Community. Designed for use in any discord server, be it an individuals private server, a small guild's servers, or a large discord gaming community.

Saber is developed in Java 8 with the JDA discord api. I am currently publicly hosting this bot. 

### [Rider](http://nmathe.ws/bots/rider "Rider bot") 

A simple 'Looking For Group' bot to add party-finder like functionality to your Discord Server. Designed for medium to large discord communities, Rider keeps your communities looking for group channel clean and clutter-free.

Rider is developed in Java 8 with the JDA discord api. I am currenlty publicly hosting this bot.
