The default command prefix is ``!``, however ``@Saber`` can also be used to trigger bot commands.

<br>

### Quick Start

1. Invite Saber-Bot and create a channel named **#saber_control**

2. Use ``!init in #saber_control`` to create a schedule.
    * If a channel named **#new_schedule** is not created, give Saber-Bot Manage Channel permissions.
    
3. Use ``!config #new_schedule`` to view schedule settings

4. Use ``!guild prefix $`` to change the command prefix to ``$``.

5. Use ``$zones "US"`` to view available timezone codes for the United States.
    * Experiment with this command to find a timezone which best represents your locale.

6. Use ``$config #new_schedule zone [timezone]``, where ``[timezone]`` is the timezone you found in step 5.
    * It is best to always configure your schedule's timezone before adding events.

7. Use ``$create #new_schedule "Hi mom!" 5:45pm`` to create a new event
    * If no message appears in #new_schedule, check to insure Saber-Bot has read, write, and manage message perms
    
8. To delete the test schedule and event use ``$delete #new_schedule`` to remove the schedule.
    * Alternatively, the schedule channel can be manually deleted for the same affect. The same goes for the event messages.
   
Make use of the ``help`` command, read the docs, or ask in the support server to learn more about the commands. I hope @Saber fulfills your guild's scheduling needs!

<br>

### Server Setup

Saber bot is designed to save events of schedule on dedicated "schedule channels." 

Scheduling channels require Saber be given some permissions, which should already have been requested if Saber joined your server using the above oath link.  Insure that Saber has the Manage Channels permission and the ability to read/write on any channel you plan to have her announce on.

In addition to schedule channels, Saber bot is configured to listen for scheduling commands only on a dedicated channel.  Create a channel with the name "saber_control," and allow Saber to view and send messages to it.

After the first ``guild`` command is issued in ``#saber_control``, the name of the control channel can be customized without affecting the behavior of the bot.

<br>

### Commands

Saber commands are of the form ``!command <arguments>``; an argument is any space separated, quotation enclosed phrase -- with the exception of single word phrases which may drop the quotations. 

Here's an example : ``!create #event_schedule "Rampage on Monday" 8:00am 9:00pm``. Saber will parse out four tokens from that command: ``#event_schedule``, ``Rampage on Monday``, ``8:00am``, and ``9:00pm``.

For each of the following commands, ``<argument>`` denotes an argument and ``[argument(s)]`` denotes optional arguments.

<br />

+ ``!create <#channel> <title> <start> [<end> <option(s)>]``
  
  Every new entry MUST be initialized with a title and a starting time.  Start and end times should be of form h:mm with optional am/pm appended on the end (ex. ``10:20pm``). The ``<end>`` parameter may be ommitted to create an event which does not end at any particular time.
  
  Events can be created with a variety of extra options by adding specific keywords followed by a required value to the ``<option(s)>`` section. Comments are the only exception to the previous rule. Comments may be added to an event's description by simply appending quotation enclosed phrases to the end of the command (see examples). A list of ``<option>`` keywords can be found later in this document.
  
  * Ex1. ``!create #event_schedule "Party in the Guild Hall" 19:00 2:00 date 04/10`` 
  * Ex2. ``!create "#event_channel Reminders" "Sign up for Raids" 4:00pm``
  * Ex3. ``!create "#event_channel Raids" "Weekly Raid Event" 7:00pm 12:00pm repeat "Fr,Sa" "Healers and tanks always in demand." "DM @RaidCaptain with your role and level if attending."``
  
  <br />
  
+ ``!edit <id> <option> <changes>``

  This command can be used to change any parameter of an event given the event's ID. The first argument is always the event ID, the second argument should be the keyword for the parameter you wish to change, and the third argument is the new value. The edit command uses the same option keywords as the create command.
  
  ``comment`` is the only exception to this rule.  When 'comment' is the second argument, the third argument needs to be either ``add`` , ``remove``, or ``swap`` (to denote the which action to take). If using the ``add`` or ``remove`` actions, a fourth argument representing the comment number or new comment needs to be provided. If using the ``swap`` action, two additional arguments representing the comment numbers to swap are required. See examples below.
  
  * Ex1: ``!edit 3fa021 comment add "Attendance is mandatory"``
  * Ex2: ``!edit 0abf58 start 21:15``
  * Ex3: ``!edit 49a83f end 2:15pm``
  * Ex4: ``!edit 80c012 comment remove 1``
  * Ex5: ``!edit aa2134 comment swap 1 2``
  
   <br />
 
+ ``!delete <id|#channel|all>``

  This command can be used to delete an event or schedule. Passing the event ID as the first argument will delete the individual event, passing a channel mention to a schedule's channel will delete the schedule, and passing the word 'all' will result in the deletion of every scheduled event on the server.  This command is not necessary to safely delete events and schedules.  Guild administrators can delete the discord message or discord channel which represents the event or schedule to safely remove both.
  
  * Ex1: ``!delete 10ada9d``
  * Ex2: ``!delete #new_schedule``
  * Ex3: ``!delete all``
  
    <br />

+ ``!config <#channel> <option> <new_config>``

  When only the first argument (#channel) is provided, the currently configured settings for that schedule is return. Those settings can be modified by issuing the settings name as the second argument and the new configuration as the third argument. The list of ``<option>`` keywords are detailed later in this documentation.
  
  * Ex1: ``!config #schedule msg "@here Event %a: %t"``
  * Ex2: ``!config #schedule chan general``
  * Ex3: ``!config #schedule clock 12``
  * Ex4: ``!config #schedule remind "30, 10, 5 min"``
  
    <br />

+ ``!guild <option> <new_config>``

  This command may be used to modify guild-wide settings, such as your guild's command prefix and control channel. Issuing the guild command without arguments will output the current settings for your discord server. With this command you can specify which commands are 'restricted' and 'unrestricted'. A restricted command can only be used in the designated bot control channel. An unrestricted command may be used in any channel and by anyone so long as the bot has appropriate permissions to view and post in that channel. The list of ``<option>`` keywords are detailed later in this documentation.
  
  * Ex1: ``!guild``
  * Ex2: ``!guild prefix $``
  * Ex3: ``!guild restrict init``
  * Ex4: ``!guild unrestrict help``
  
  <br />

+ ``!sync <#schedule_channel> <calendar address>``

  This command will replace all events in the specified channel with events imported from a public google calendar. Up to the next 7 days of events will be imported. To learn more, see the **Synchronize a Schedule with Google Calendar** guide below. The schedule will re-import from the google calendar once per day automatically. While a schedule is synchronizing, the schedule can not be modified and new events may not be added.

  * Ex: ``!sync #schedule [. . .]``
  
  <br />

+ ``!zones <filter>``

  This command will output all timezones which match the provided filter. The filter is a character or string, any timezone whose name contains the the filter will be matched. The filter is required.
  
  * Ex: ``!zones us``
  
  <br />
  
+ ``!test <event_id>``

  The test command will send an test announcement for the event to the bot control channel. The announcement message format is controlled by the schedule to which the event belongs to, and can be changed using the config command. Â 
  
  * Ex: ``!test 02ac9b``
  
  <br />
 
+ ``!list <event_id> [<mode> <filter(s)>]``

  The list command will show all users who have rsvp'ed for an event. The command takes a single argument which should be the ID of the event you wish query. The schedule holding the event must have 'rsvp' turned on in the configuration settings. RSVP can be enabled on a channel using the config command as followed, ``!config #channel rsvp on``. 
  Mobile discord clients may have trouble rendering the embedded output of this command.  If so, the command 'mode' may be set to mobile by appending ``mobile`` to command arguments. For a view more conducive to copy and pasting the list of RSVPers else where, try the ``id`` mode.
  The output of this command can be filtered by role, user, and type. Reference examples 2 and 3 below to see how this can be done.
  
  * Ex1: ``!list 39a0da3``
  * Ex1: ``!list 39a0da3 mobile``
  * Ex2: ``!list 109ad2a "u: @notem``
  * Ex3: ``!list 019fa92 "t: yes" "r: @admin"``
  
  <br />

+ ``!sort <#schedule_channel>``

  The sort command will re-sort the entries in a schedule. Entries are reordered so that the top event entry is the next event to begin. The schedule cannot be modified while in the process of sorting. Schedules with more than 10 entries will not be sorted. The order in which the schedule is sorted can be specified by appending 'asc' (ascending order) or 'desc' (descending order) to the command.
  
  * Ex1: ``!sort #schedule``
  * Ex2: ``!sort #my_schedule asc``
  * Ex3: ``!sort #my_schedule desc``
  
  <br />

+ ``!help [command]``

  Direct messages the user a list of commands that can be used in Saber's dedicated control channel. If a command is supplied as the optional first argument, additional usage information for that command is provided. The information provided by the <code>help</code> command is likely to be more up-to-date than the documentation here.
  
  * Ex1: ``!help``
  * Ex2: ``!help edit``

<br>

### Synchronize with Google Calendar

1. Create a public calendar with Google Calendar. To set the calendar public, you should find a sharing setting near that looks something like this: 

 <br />
 <img src="%base_url%/assets/MakePublic.JPG" alt="Make calendar public" style="max-width:90%;">
 <br />

2. (optional) If you already have a calendar setup, but not yet made it public, you can toggle the calendar's share settings in the 'Calendar settings'>>'Share this calendar tab' It should look something like this: 
  
  <br />
  <img src="%base_url%/assets/ChangeShareSettings.JPG" alt="Change calendar share settings" style="max-width:90%;">
  <br />
  
3. Next, you'll need to find the calendar's public address.  The calendar's public address is listed near the end in the calendar's settings webpage under the 'Calendar details' tab. It should look something like this: 

 <br />
 <img src="%base_url%/assets/PublicAddress.JPG" alt="Your calendar's public address" style="max-width:90%;">
 <br />

4. Finally, use the ``!sync <#channel> <address>`` command in your discord server's saber_control channel to sync the events in your public calendar to the schedule. 
  
  The timer is automatically setup to resync the channel to your calendar once every day. However, if changes are made to the Google Calendar the channel will not show such changes until resync. Either wait until auto-sync, or reuse the ``sync`` command.
  
  <br />

5. If you wish to unsync the channel from your google calendar, use the ``config`` command (ex. ``!config #channel sync off``).

Google Calendar events can be configured to sync some additional information to the Saber's discord schedules by including specific information in the description of the Google Calendar event.

<br />

### Create and Edit Options
An edit command should be formatted like ``!edit <ID> <keyword> <argument(s)>``

A create command differs in that several keywords and arguments may be used. 
So, a create command should look something like ``!create <#channel> <title> <start> [end] [keyword] [argument(s)] ... [keyword] [argument]``

The table below details what can be used in the [keyword] and [argument(s)] sections of the command

#### Setting a Custom Announcement Message
Every schedule channel is configured with it's own message to announce to a specified channel when an event begins or ends. With the ``config`` command the message can be configured.

Saber will announce the message string verbatum unless a '%' character is encountered.  When a '%' character is encountered, Saber will read the next character(s) and substitute the token with whatever value is associated that character combination.

If you are having trouble understanding how this behaves, experiment with different message formats using the ``config`` and ``test`` commands.

### Self-Hosting Saber Bot

1. Saber-bot has been developed using the Java 8 programming language. To run this application, you will need to download and install the [Java 8 runtime environment](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html) for your system.

2. Saber-bot uses MongoDB to store the persistent event and schedule data. Install [the latest version of MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) on your system. I suggest you setup MongoDB to run on system startup as well.

3. With the prequisite software installed, you should now be able to launch the bot application. Download the latest version of the bot from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B0zQK1JmyZGJdVdFQ1IxUi1haXc?usp=sharing), or compile from the bot from source using Maven. 

4. Running the .jar file for the first time should cause the application to generate a fresh configuration file and close. Add your discord bot token and your discord user ID to the configuration file and restart the bot. 

5. To have Google Calendar integration, you need to generate new credentials on the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials). Generate a new 'service account key' and download the key as a JSON file type. Modify the configuration file's ``google_service_key`` settings to indicate the location of your service key file.

6. Some notes on the ``saber.toml`` configuration file:
    * If you have configured you're MongoDB application to a non-default state the ``mongodb`` setting may need to be adjusted.
    * The ``web_token`` setting is used to share bot metrics with bots.discord.pw, and is completely optional.
    * Sharding is typically unnecessary for self-hosted applications. If sharding is disabled by default with the ``shard_total`` set to 0. However, if you decide to enable sharding the ``shard_total`` configures the total number of shards used by all instances of the bot and most always be equal to or greater than the number of shards in the ``shards`` list.  The ``shards`` list should contain the shard IDs for each shard the local application should manage.
    * The ``rsvp_yes``, ``rsvp_no``, and ``rsvp_clear`` are unicode emoticons. If your server does not have the required packages installed, the emoticons may not be processed correctly. If so, use the escaped unicode IDs (``\u2705``, ``\u274c`` and ``\u2754``) instead.
